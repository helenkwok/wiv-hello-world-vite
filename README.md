# Hello world IFC.js WIV Using Vite React-TS

Currently IFC.js does not have a Vite React example (an alternative to Create React App). So, I made one based on the [hello world repository](https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world).

## Quick setup

First, download this project or clone the repository and install the dependencies with `git clone https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world`. You can then install the dependencies using `npm install` and build all the examples with `npm run build`.

You can then execute the examples serving them locally with `git run preview`.
